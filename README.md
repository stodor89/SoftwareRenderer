# SoftwareRenderer
This is a renderer I'm making as a part of Pikuma's "3D Graphics Programming form Scratch" course.

### Usage
1. Generate
2. Build
3. Move resulting SDL3.dll file to executable directory
4. ???????
5. Profit!

### TODO
- Finish the renderer, duh
- Testing
- Platforms other than Windoze/VS
- Organize static stuff inside Main.cpp
- Build/Install procedure improvements
- OOP where it makes sense
